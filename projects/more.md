# Moar

## A developer? Me? Never.
I have over 50 repositories on my personal GitHub account, which is a testament to the fact that I've been doing something for over a decade. Some of it was good, some of it was... less good. And some of it was, you know, definitely not legal. I lost a lot of code, back in the good old days when GitHub was basically a fancy ransom service for private repos.

My code is what you might define lazy, because I have absolutely zero interest in maintaining anything. I write code I can use for years to come without having to touch it again, because who has the time?

None of these projects were developed for the usual developer's holy trinity of "fame, fortune, and glory." It's always been about personal use and the pure joy of learning, a philosophy I've held onto since my first dabble with Visual Basic during the millennium bug scare.
