# Kodi® Add-ons

In years I developed and mantained several **Kodi add-ons**, mainly for Italian content.

### Projects

* **Rai Play:** An add-on to stream content from the official Italian public broadcaster.
* **Mediaset Play:** For accessing on-demand shows and live channels from Mediaset.
* **DPlay:** To watch content from the Discovery Italia network.
* **SkyTG24, Cielo, and TV8:** A combined add-on for news and entertainment from these major Italian channels.
* **VVVVID:** An add-on for streaming anime and series from the VVVVID platform.

In addition to these, I have also developed add-ons for **EPG (Electronic Program Guide) generation**, which scrape data directly from official broadcaster portals to provide accurate and up-to-date TV guides. I've also implemented features that allow users to watch **live content** provided directly by the copyright holders, ensuring a fully legitimate and user-friendly experience.

A significant part of my work has involved navigating the evolution of the Kodi platform. I have successfully managed the **migration of several add-ons from Python 2.7 to Python 3**, ensuring their continued functionality and compatibility with the latest versions of Kodi. This experience has given me a deep understanding of the platform's architecture and best practices for creating robust and maintainable code.

## An open source chapter

As with all great stories, this one has also reached its conclusion. After many years of active development and collaboration, I have completely stepped away from the Italian Kodi community. The add-ons I created and maintained are now in the hands of the community, which I hope will continue to use and enjoy them. I am immensely grateful for the journey and the trust placed in me by users and fellow developers.

If you're using any italian Kodi addon there're quite chance that some lines of code've written by me :)
