### 🚀 Quick Start

Getting started is easy.

#### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js installed on your computer to use the `sync.js` script.

1.  **Set Up Your Site**
    Start by configuring your blog in `js/site.js`.

    ```javascript
    const SITE_SETTINGS = {
        siteName: "Charon Engine",
        footerText: "© 2024 Charon Engine. All rights reserved.",
        postsPath: "posts",
        imagesPath: "images",
        pagesPath: "pages", 
        logoNavbarPath: null,
        logoMainPath: "assets/logo.png",
        faviconPath: "assets/favicon.ico",
        viewMode: "grid", // Choose between "grid" or "list"
        enableAnimations: false // true enables animations, false disables them
    };
    ```

2.  **Create Your Content**
    Just drop your Markdown files into the `posts/` or `pages/` folders. Don't worry about editing `data/post.js` or `data/pages.js`—the script handles that for you.

3.  **Automagic**
    Run the synchronization script from your terminal.

    ```bash
    node sync.js
    ```

    This command will perform the following operations:
    * Scans the `posts/` and `pages/` directories.
    * Automatically updates `data/post.js` and `data/pages.js` with new entries.
    * Creates a dedicated image folder for each new post, if one doesn't exist.

4.  **Serve and Enjoy**
    Simply open `index.html` in your favorite web browser. For local development, a simple web server (like `live-server` or Python's built-in server) is highly recommended to avoid CORS issues.

### 🎨 Customization

* **Global Settings**: Edit `js/site.js` to change the site name, footer, logos, layout mode ("grid" or "list"), and animations.
* **Custom CSS**: Override any default styles by adding your own rules to `css/custom.css`.
* **Post Metadata**: Edit the `data/post.js` file to manually add metadata like `author`, `publicationDate`, and `tags` for your posts.
